# `@devdigest/reviewer-core` — the review engine

Pure review logic: **diff → prompt → LLM → grounded findings**. No database,
GitHub, or filesystem; the only side effect is an LLM call through an **injected**
`LLMProvider`, which is what makes it mock-testable.

The **server** (`@devdigest/api`) consumes it for local reviews in the studio;
`agent-runner` is the second consumer, running the exact same engine inside a
target repo's own GitHub Actions. The server wires it via a tsconfig
path alias (`@devdigest/reviewer-core` → `../reviewer-core/src`) and consumes the
TypeScript **source** directly (tsx in dev, vitest in tests). The package never
emits JS — its `build` is a type-check.

## Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  IN["inputs<br/>diff · system prompt · repo map"] --> PROMPT["assemblePrompt()<br/>prompt.ts"]
  PROMPT --> WRAP["wrapUntrusted() + INJECTION_GUARD<br/>fence untrusted content vs prompt injection"]
  WRAP --> LLM["LLMProvider (injected)<br/>llm/openrouter.ts"]
  LLM --> STRUCT["structured output<br/>llm/structured.ts<br/>Zod → JSON Schema · parse-with-repair"]
  STRUCT --> GROUND["groundFindings()<br/>grounding.ts<br/>mechanical citation gate vs the diff"]
  GROUND --> OUT["Review<br/>verdict · score · grounded findings"]
```

The grounding step is the mandatory gate: a finding that doesn't cite a real line
in the diff is dropped, so the engine can't hallucinate locations. The score is
recomputed deterministically from the **surviving** findings, not trusted from the
model. `review/run.ts` orchestrates the run (single-pass by default).

The engine also accepts optional prompt slots — `skills`, `memory`, `specs`,
`callers` — plus a `reduce()`/map-reduce path and a `toReview()` CI payload
helper used by `agent-runner`. The server (`run-executor.ts`) now wires in
`skills`, `callers`, `repoMap`, and `specs`; `memory` is the one slot still
not fed into the prompt. Any slot that's omitted simply isn't rendered —
`assemblePrompt` leaves that section out rather than erroring.

## Public API

Exported from `src/index.ts`: `assemblePrompt` / `wrapUntrusted` (prompt),
`groundFindings` / `groundingSummary` (grounding), `toJsonSchema` / `extractJson`
/ `parseWithRepair` (structured output), plus the `run` entrypoint and
`reduce`. Contracts (`Review`, `Finding`, `Verdict`, …) come from
`@devdigest/shared`.

## Testing

`npm test` (vitest) — hermetic units with a stubbed `LLMProvider`: prompt
assembly, the grounding gate, `toReview` selection, and a full `run`. No keys,
no network. `npm run typecheck` doubles as the build. See
[`../TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md).
